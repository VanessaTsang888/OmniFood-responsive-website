IMPORTANT NOTES:

Using classes in HTML to select everything to layout and style in CSS.

Span <span></span> is a generic text element.
Div <div></div> is just a container without any semanic meaning.

Img's don't auto scale up or down like text do so we have to do this manually:
-> .step-img {
width: 50%;
}
