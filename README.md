# Responsive Restaurant Website

I am developing a fully responsive restaurant website using HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript ES6. As well as using digital accessibility and usability conforming to the W3C Web Accessibility Initiative:

- CSS3 Media Queries.
- modern flexbox and CSS Grid.
- Planning, sketching, designing, building, testing, optimizing, and launching a responsive website.

## Why?

Before I became a Frontend UI Software Engineer I was working as a responsive website designer using plain HTML, CSS and Javascript. Around my full time job I am using this personal project to stay up-to-date with these languages as I feel these skills makes me a better FE Software Engineer and I enjoying being innovative in my development work.

Around this personal project I am working on a couple of Udemy training course which are more based on UI Development using Javascript framework/library - React.js (with TypeScript), Vue.js with Vuex. As a FE Software Engineer it is important for me to keep upskilling in my UI Development skills and keep up with the technologies within software engineering as much as possible.

### Tools

For the IDE I am using VSCode and various plugins.

### How To Run This Website

Simple open the HTML file in your Google Chrome browser. Then you will be able to navigate arund the website. I will be using GitHub Pages to host this website and I will provide the link to that here in the near future.
